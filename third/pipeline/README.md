All that we have learned so far will come in handy when it is time to create a pipeline! We could define a pipeline in the following way:

A pipeline is a set of instructions that will be executed on a server with the goal of building and deploying your application.

Those set of instructions really come together inside a pipeline in a way that allows us more flexibility! An efficient pipeline can benefit developers in the following ways:

Faster feedback about the code
Getting features deployed faster
To learn pipelines we will cover the following topics in this lesson.

Basics of a pipeline: We will learn how everything comes together and enables automation around deployments.
Continuous Integration: We will understand the different steps that a pipeline executes that form the CI portion of this.
Continuous Delivery: We will learn how deployments can be automated after an application is built and tested.
Documentation: We will learn to document a pipeline and the different operations around an application.
