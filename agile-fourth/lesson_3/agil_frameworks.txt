Agile Frameworks are Enablers that Bring to Fruition the Value of Agile
This includes:

Focusing more on the individuals and interactions; ultimate determining factor for the success of a product are the resources on the Agile product delivery team.
Do not force Agile unnecessarily; Teams that are already performing well can be gradually introduced to additional Agile practices based on a specific Agile Framework.
Refined user stories are important; Agilists work with Product Owners to ensure the user stories have been sufficiently refined for the Agile Team to proceed.
Respect the backlog; Agilists focus on ensuring the Agile Team does not over-commit to what can be accomplished in each iteration, especially during the first few iterations.


Implementing a Specific Agile Framework is a Fine Balancing Act
Must adapt based on each organizationâ€™s unique culture and context.
Experts have to regularly remind both leaders and the Agile Team to remember that there is no one way to execute Agile practices in an organization.
Agile principles and practices are by their very nature to be adapted as needed.
