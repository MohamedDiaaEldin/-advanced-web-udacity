Scrum Framework
Scrum is by far the most common Agile Framework.

The features are delivered in iterations known as Sprints.
The Team conducts Daily Stand-Ups in which they provide updates to each other.
Retrospectives are conducted to identify opportunities for improvement at the end of each Sprint.
Specific roles, as well as certain Ceremonies are recommended in the Scrum Framework.
Scrum Pillars
Transparency - Transparency builds trust and openness both within the Agile Team, as well as with those stakeholders outside the Agile Team.
Inspection - Inspection involves the business users reviewing the Agile Teamâ€™s progress towards the defined goals.
Adaptation - Agile Teams adjust and adapt based on opportunities for improvement that are identified either by the Agile Team themselves or through feedback from others outside the team
