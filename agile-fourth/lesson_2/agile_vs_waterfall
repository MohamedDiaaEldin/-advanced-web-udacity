Conditions Where Agile May Not Be Helpful:
Lack of agreement in terms of requirements and process
No vision and no clear roadmap
Near certainty on requirements and process upfront
Conditions Where Agile Works Best:
An environment of complexity and some uncertainty where an adaptive approach is needed
With complicated requirements that need iterative cycles to understand the needs of end-users
New Terms
Incremental Product Delivery: An approach that utilizes a given number of steps, which go from start to finish following a linear path of progression
Iterative Product Delivery: An approach where product development is broken into sequences of time-boxed, repeated cycles called iterations
Sequential Product Delivery: A process where a defined sequence of steps must be followed as in the Waterfall approach
Stacey Diagram: A diagram developed by Ralph Stacey to categorize the complexity of a project
Waterfall Methodology: A methodology of product development which starts by breaking down project tasks into linear sequential phases or stages
where each subsequent stage depends on the successful delivery of the previous ones.
